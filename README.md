# DNAmFitAge
Calculate estimates for DNAm fitness biomarkers, DNAmFitAge, and FitAge Acceleration 

Code to accompany DNAmFitAge: Biological Age Indicator Incorporating Physical Fitness publishing in Aging Albany. 


Calculate DNAmGaitspeed, DNAmGripmax, DNAmFEV1, DNAmFitAge, and FitAgeAcceleration using blood DNA methylation. 

# DNAmFitnessandDNAmFitAgeSourceFunctions.R 
This includes 5 functions that will calculate the DNAm fitness estimates. 

# CodetoRun.R
Is the code users can run. This includes an example based on simulated data. The simulated data is kept in Sample_Simulation_Data.rds

# DNAmFitnessModelsandFitAge_Oct2022.rds
Houses the models used for each fitness biomarker and median values of CpGs. Median values of CpGs are used when your dataframe does not measure them.
